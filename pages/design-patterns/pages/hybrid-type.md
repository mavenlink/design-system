A form/table hybrid page consists of a combination of form and table on the same page. 
Examples of this include the New Template page, Expenses page, and Invoices page. 
The basic anatomy of a form/table hybrid page consists of the following:

1. Header and optional description
1. Primary/Secondary action buttons
1. Tertiary action buttons
1. Form containing input components - laid out according to Form Page Type specifications
1. Table - laid out according to Form Table Type specifications
1. Pagination
   - The pagination bar on every table/form hybrid page should be fixed to the bottom of the page. The exception to this is if the page contains multiple tables (such as the Time & Expense page inside a project)
