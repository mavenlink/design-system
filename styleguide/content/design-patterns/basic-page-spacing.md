The following page spacing guidelines apply to any custom application that is embedded in a tab inside of Mavenlink, or exists on its own independent page.

<div class="header-four">Base Page Margins</div>
Page top and left margins should always use `spacing-x-large`:

<img class="image" alt="page margins example" src="images/page-margins-example.jpg"/>

Page Title should be displayed against page top margin. If there is a page description, the space between Page Title and Page Description should use `spacing-large`:

<img class="image" alt="page title margins example" src="images/page-title-margins.jpg" />

If there is NOT a page description, the page between Page Title and Seciton header should use `spacing-x-large`:

<img class="image" alt="page title no text example" src="images/page-title-no-text.jpg" />

<div class="header-four">Page Section Margins</div>

A ‘Section’ consists of a subheader, a collection of components, and can also include action buttons (Save, Cancel). 

Section Header should be displayed at top of Section and should be left-aligned against margin. If there is a section description, the space between Section Header and Section Description should use `spacing-large`. Spacing between Section Description and Components should also be `spacing-large`.

<img class="image-top" alt="section header margins" src="images/section-header-margins.jpg" />
<img class="image" alt="section header margins with text" src="images/section-header-margins-2.jpg" />

If there is NOT a section description, the space between Section Header and Components should still use `spacing-large`.

<img class="image" alt="section header margins without text" src="images/section-header-margins-no-description.jpg" />

Within a section, components should be vertically spaced from each other using `spacing-large`.

<img class="image" alt="section with multiple components" src="images/section-header-margins-with-components.jpg" />

Spacing between the last component in a section and action buttons OR another section should use `spacing-x-large`.

<img class="image-top" alt="section with buttons" src="images/section-margins-with-buttons.jpg" />
<img class="image" alt="section without buttons" src="images/section-margins-without-buttons.jpg" />

In general, elements on the page should align horizontally to the left side of the page. If the page consists of a table or grid of components, the farthest left component should align to the left side of the page, against margin. Horizontal space between Components should use `spacing-x-large`.

<img class="image" alt="section space between" src="images/section-space-between.jpg" />

Action buttons (Save, Cancel) should be aligned horizontally, with the primary action button on the farthest left, against the margin. Horizontal spacing between Action Buttons should use `spacing-medium`.
